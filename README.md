A bunch of tools for maintaining the TeXShop/TeXShop repository.

### texshop-scan.py

new source code releases. When a new release is detected, it is
downloaded.

### import-zips.py
With the import-zips.py tool, one can import a bunch of ZIP files
containing TeXShop releases into a git repository.
