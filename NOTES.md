# Notes on TeXShop history

## Annoyances and oddities

* In 2.34, the folder Resources/TeXShop/Engines/Inactive/luaTeX was
  renamed to  Resources/TeXShop/Engines/Inactive/LuaTeX
  -> this causes some annoyance on HFS+, due to missing case sensitivity



## Release dates

The import-zips.py script tries to derive a "last changed" date from each ZIP
file, which is used to produce the timestamp for the commit created from that
ZIP.

The dates listed below were obtained from the now defunct versiontracker.com.
The dates probably are only "upper bounds" for the actual release, as a few
days could pass before Versiontracker recorded a release. Still, several of
these release dates are way before the release dates we obtain from the
script. One cause for that is that sometimes the ZIP files are not those which
were originally released ones, but rather fresh ones Richard made for me from
extracted source directories. In other cases, sometimes an already released
ZIP files was actually modified with "trivial" (?) fixes and re-uploaded.

The dates below could / should be used to fix at least some of the 2.x
releases, which currently are sometimes "out of order".
